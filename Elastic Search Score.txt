A scoring algorith assigns a higher score to more relevant results and lesser scores to less relevant results.

Previous workshop is basic queries

the MATCH query returns just about anything where you can find the serach terms, even if the words are spread apart and 3 search terms are not all found together. 

MATCH might pull up documents with search terms that are scattered across the document. This may not always be what we want.

BUT there is a MATCH PHRASE quary which searches for greater details.

MATCH PHRASE TRIES TO FIND THE ENTIRE PHRASE

The Question of the day is

FULL TEXT QUERIES

COMBINED QUERIES

FINE TUNE THE RELEVANCE OF RESULTS


BOOL QUERIES HAVE MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, FILTER

THESE ARE ALL OPTIONAL QUERIES.
