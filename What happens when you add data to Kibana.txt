WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ADD DATA TO KIBANA

It analyzes the first 1000 lines
There is some data at the bottom.

BUT you have to hit the import button to import the data into Elasticserach working with cloud.

When you hit IMPORT you made an INDEX called news headlines.

GET news_headlines/_search
This GET give you info on your data and a sample of 10 search results by default.

Elastic Search limits total value to 10000 as a default

HOW TO KNOW EXACT TOTAL NUMBER OF HITS

GET news_headlines/_search
{
  "track_total_hits": true
}

QUERIES AND AGGREGATIONS are 2 ways to search in elasticsearch

QUERIES are used to retrieve documents that meet the criteria that you place.

AGGREGATIONS summerize your data as metrics, statistics, and other analytics.

SEARCH BETWEEN 2 DATES

GET news_headlines/_search
{
  "query": {
    "range":{
      "date":{
        "gte": "2015-06-20",
        "lte": "2015-09-22"
      }
    }
  }
}

GTE means greater than or exact


NOW HERE IS AN ACTUAL AGGREGATE SEARCH BY 100 CATEGORIES

GET news_headlines/_search
{
  "aggs": {
    "by_category": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "category",
        "size": 100
      }
    }
  }
}

LOOKING AT THE ENTERTAINMENT CATEGORY IN GREATER DETAIL

GET news_headlines/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "category": "ENTERTAINMENT"
    }
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "popular_in_entertainment": {
      "significant_text": {
        "field": "headline"
      }
    }
  }
}

if you run this below it will find too many results


GET news_headlines/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "headline": {
        "query": "Khloe Kardashian Kendall Jenner"
      }
    }
  }
}

BUT YOU CAN ADD AND--containing all 4 search terms
BUT THIS IS EXTREMELY STRICT

GET news_headlines/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "headline": {
        "query": "Khloe Kardashian Kendall Jenner",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}

HERE IS KIND OF A MIDDLE DOWN THE ROAD GOOD OPTION

GET news_headlines/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "headline": {
        "query": "Khloe Kardashian Kendall Jenner",
        "minimum_should_match": 3
      }
    }
  }
}
