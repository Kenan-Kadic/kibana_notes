WHAT IS MAPPING?

Trying to optimize the performance of Elasticsearch
Trying to save disk space

Mapping defines field types - defines how is information stored?

Data is stored as DOCUMENTS - meaning a JSON object containing whatever data you want to store as documents. 
It has fields as key value pairs.

There is different JSON types for the value pairs.
Some JSONS are Strings, some are Booleans and some are Integers.

How do you index a document?
