WHAT IS MAPPING?

Trying to optimize the performance of Elasticsearch
Trying to save disk space

Mapping defines field types - defines how is information stored?

Data is stored as DOCUMENTS - meaning a JSON object containing whatever data you want to store as documents. 
It has fields as key value pairs.

There is different JSON types for the value pairs.
Some JSONS are Strings, some are Booleans and some are Integers.

How do you index a document?

POST temp_index/_doc
{
  "name": "Pineapple",
  "botanical_name": "Ananas comosus",
  "produce_type": "Fruit",
  "country_of_origin": "New Zealand",
  "date_purchased": "2020-06-02T12:15:35",
  "quantity": 200,
  "unit_price": 3.11,
  "description": "a large juicy tropical fruit consisting of aromatic edible yellow flesh surrounded by a tough segmented skin and topped with a tuft of stiff leaves.These pineapples are sourced from New Zealand.",
  "vendor_details": {
    "vendor": "Tropical Fruit Growers of New Zealand",
    "main_contact": "Hugh Rose",
    "vendor_location": "Whangarei, New Zealand",
    "preferred_vendor": true
  }
}

BUT WHAT HAPPENS BEHIND THE SCENES?

Depending on its type, each field is stored differently.

There is a default mapping system called Dynamic Mapping.

There will be a list of all field names and types

A lot of stuff is in alphabetical order in a default index.

if you search the index - the field types are revealed

GET Enter_name_of_the_index_here/_mapping

YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THE MAPPING
