If SPEED and RELEVANCE of search matter - you need Elasticsearch

Kibana helps you visualize the data Kibana creates a dashboard to visualize data in graphs and charts.

Elasticsearch runs on nodes - each node has a unique ID and a name. 
The nodes are part of a cluster. You can have more than 1 node per cluster and they are distributed across several machines.NODES members of a cluster that share a common goalA node can hold dataDATA is stored as documentsâ€¦meaning a JSON objectSimilar items are grouped into indexes - they say indicies.You might have a produce index and a wine and beer index.Data is stored in shards. Indexes can have multiple shards distributed in nodes.Shard is where documents are stored.
You can always add more shards and nodes as you get more DATAShard is also where you run search queries.If you have 10 shards across 10 nodes - you can run a 500k search with 50k each shard in 1 secondIf you ran searches in single shards it would take a long time to get results
