WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENS WHEN A NODE GOES DOWN?
Lets say a 50k piece of data open

Copies of original shards called primary shards can be kept on nodes 1 or 2 for example

They can be labled P0 P1 and R0 and R1.
There are replica shards and they can be backups

Replica shards can also improve the quality of your searches

As your App grows primary shards may have trouble keeping up with the search queries. The R1 and R2 are identical copies of P0 and P1.
