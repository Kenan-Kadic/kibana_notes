Elasticserach is a super powerful serach engine.

It is very fast.

Data is stored as JSON documents.

DATA CAN RUN in multiple nodes--running in multiple servers.

You can add more nodes

Elasticserach stores data as JSON documents.

Elasticsearch has an inverted index.

Elasticsearch is really good at finding where things are / reappear and how often they happen.

Data is saved essentially as a search. It makes things easy to find.

WHAT IS A nodes
A server running an elastic search instance

Multiple nodes can work on searching data at the same time.

An Index tells us where things are stored. Just look an index in a book almost. It knows exactly where things are. Similar to a book index.

NOW Databases change every second. So how do you update the index?

Initial startup updates the data. Also it updates as new information comes in. If index gets too large, can take a long time to start things up.

Share the load is the key here for everything. That is why Elasticstac is so fast. Sharding is happening.

The more nodes you get the more you have to thinkg about how to monitor them. You may even need a monitoring tool.
